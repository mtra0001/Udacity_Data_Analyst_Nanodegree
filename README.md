# Udacity_Data_Analyst_Nanodegree

This repository includes all the assignments I performed in my Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree class. Modules include the following:

- Analyze raw data using SQL
- Intro to Python
- Intro to Data Analysis
- Practical Statistics
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data Wrangling
- Data Story Telling

## Project 1 - Explore US Bikeshare Data
First project involved writing a Python code to import US bike share data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

## Project 2 - Investigate a Dataset
I've investigated a curated Soccer Dataset using NumPy and pandas. The Soccer Dataset which is made up of six different tables contains data for soccer matches, players, and teams form several European Countries from 2008 to 2016.

## Project 3 - Analyze A/B Test Results
For this project I looked into the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. My goal was to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

## Project 4 - Test a Perceptual Phenomenon
Use descriptive statistics and a statistical test to analyze the Stroop effect, a classic result of experimental psychology.

## Project 5 - Explore and Summarize Data
Use R and apply exploratory data analysis techniques to explore relationships in one variable to multiple variables and to explore a selected data set for distributions, outliers, and anomalies.

## Project 6 - Wrangle and Analyze Data
Gather, assess, and clean data then act on it through analysis, visualization and/or modeling.

## Project 7 - Create a Tableau Story
Create a data visualization that tells a story or highlights trends or patterns in a data set.
